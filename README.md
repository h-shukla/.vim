# What is it?
My personal vim configuration

# Who might wanna use it?
People who want decent vim experience with out of the box vim features

# Things to note
- No plugins can be found here
- All the settings are sane defaults according to me
- There are useful keybindings already setup that you can see inside the file
- This kind of file structure is good as you don't have to have vimrc in the home folder

**Just copy this Repository and open up vim to get better experience than bare minimum**
